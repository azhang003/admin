sabre/cache
===========

This repository is a simple abstraction layer for key-value caches. It
implements [PSR-16][5].

If you need a super-simple way to support PSR-16, sabre/cache helps you get
started. It's as hands-off as possible.

It also comes with a test-suite that can be used by other PSR-16
implementations.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have [composer][1] installed, and then run:

    composer require sabre/cache


Usage
-----

Read [PSR-16][5] for the API. We follow it to the letter.


### In-memory cache

This is useful as a test-double for long-running processes. The `Memory` cache
only lasts as long as the object does.

```php
$cache = new \Sabre\Cache\Memory();
```


### APCu cache

This object uses the [APCu][6] api for caching. It's a fast memory cache that's
shared by multiple PHP processes.

```php
$cache = new \Sabre\Cache\Apcu();
```


### Memcached cache

This object uses the [Memcached][6] extension for caching.

```php
$memcached = new \Memcached();
$memcached->addServer('127.0.0.1', 11211);
$cache = new \Sabre\Cache\Memcached($memcached);
```

You are responsible for configuring memcached, and you just pass a fully
instantiated objected to the `\Sabre\Cache\Memcached` constructor.

# CHANGELOG

### 2.3.1 (June 27 2022)

- Added Stringable implementation for PHP 8.0 with backward compatibility.

### 2.3.0 (September 21 2021)

- Added batch ops integration.
- Added the ability to disable cache usage entirely.

### 2.2.0 (April 22nd 2021)

- Added Maps integration.
- Added versioned cache keys.
  This allows more reliable changes to cached data in the future without
  causing confusing incompatibilities. This should be transparent to the user.
  This is primarily useful for users with persistent cache implementations.

### 2.1.1 (January 12 2021)

- Bug fix issue reported in Laravel SDK
  (https://github.com/ipinfo/laravel/issues/14) which also applies in PHP SDK,
  with https://github.com/ipinfo/php/pull/27.

### 2.1.0 (December 2 2020)

- Deprecate PHP 7.2 support.
- Add support for PHP 8.0.

### 2.0.0 (November 2020)

- A `guzzle_opts` option is supported in the settings, which allows full Guzzle
  option overrides.
- A `timeout` option is supported in the settings, which is the request timeout
  value, and defaults to 2 seconds.
  **BREAKING**: this was previously unconfigurable and was 0 seconds,
  i.e. infinite timeout.
- The `buildHeaders` method on the main `IPinfo` client is now private.
  **BREAKING**: this will no longer be available for use from the client.
- Only non-EOL PHP 7 versions are supported. In particular, PHP 7.2 and above
  are all supported and tested in the CI.
